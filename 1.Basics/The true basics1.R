# How it works
# 
# In the editor on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. 
# When you hit the 'Submit Answer' button, 
# every line of code in the script is interpreted 
# and executed by R and you get a message that indicates 
# whether or not your code was correct. 
# 
# The output of your submission is shown in the console in the lower right corner.
# 
# You can also execute R commands straight in the console. 
# This is a good way to experiment with R code: 
# When you type in the console, 
# your submission will not be checked for correctness!
