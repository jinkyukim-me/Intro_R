# Variable assignment
# 
# A basic concept in R programming is the variable. 
# It allows you to store a value or an object in R. 
# You can then later use this variable's name 
# to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable. 
# You use <- to assign a variable:
# 
# my_variable <- 4


# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
